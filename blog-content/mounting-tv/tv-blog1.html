        <h2>2. Types of TV Mounts</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right TV mount is essential for achieving your desired look and functionality. Here are the three main types of mounts:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>Mounting your TV might seem intimidating, but with the right tools and steps, it’s a straightforward process. Follow these steps for a successful installation:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Choose the Right Spot:</strong> Select a wall with clear visibility from your seating area. Avoid areas with direct sunlight to reduce glare.</li>
          <li><strong>Find the Wall Studs:</strong> Use a stud finder to locate sturdy studs in the wall. Avoid mounting directly onto drywall.</li>
          <li><strong>Mark and Drill:</strong> Use the TV mount template to mark the spots for screws. Drill holes carefully, ensuring they align with the studs.</li>
          <li><strong>Attach the Mount:</strong> Secure the TV mount to the wall using screws and bolts provided in the kit.</li>
          <li><strong>Mount the TV:</strong> Attach the TV brackets to the back of your TV and lift it onto the wall mount. Double-check that everything is secure.</li>
          <li><strong>Hide the Cables:</strong> Use cable management systems or in-wall solutions to keep wires organized and out of sight.</li>
        </ol>
